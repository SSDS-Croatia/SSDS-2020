# SSDS 2020  - [5<sup>th</sup> Int'l Summer School on Data Science](https://sites.google.com/view/ssdatascience2020)

## Day 3 - Intersections between Complexity Science, Network Science and Data Science

On the third day of the school you will learn applications of complex networks methodologies to data science related problems.

In the hands-on session you will learn how to use graph-tool, Python library for efficient statistical analysis of graphs.


### Lecture materials and outline




The **Lecture** subfolder contains materials from presentations.

The **Hands-on** subfolder contain materials for hands-on session.

### Hands-on environemnt setup instructions

The hands-on session is organized as Jupyter notebooks, which you can run on your local computer.
Preparation for the hands-on session consists of setting up a python environment using Anaconda (Miniconda) and installing all necessary libraries. 
The procedure for this is as follows: ...

### The interface of Complexity and Data Science ([Nino Antulov-Fantulin](https://www.ninoaf.com/))

Complexity science studies systems and problems that are composed of many components that may interact with each other in a dynamic and non-linear way. In this talk, I  will address several research directions and problems that are lying on the interface of complexity and data science. First, I will address two research problems related to the structure of networks: 

(i) How to select the set of nodes in a network that, when removed or (de)activated, can stop the spread of (dis)information, mitigate an epidemic, or disrupt a malicious system by fragmenting it into small components at the minimum overall cost; (

ii) What is the connection between directed graphs and geometry of statistical manifolds? Afterward, I will present two problems related to the dynamics on the complex networks: 

(iii) How graph geodesics can unify continuous and discrete-time stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered processes on networks?; (iv) Can Neural Networks be used for controlling dynamical processes on complex networks? 

Finally, several Python notebooks will be given to demonstrate the practical aspects of the discussed topics.
