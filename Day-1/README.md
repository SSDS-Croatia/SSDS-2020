## Day 5 - Graph Representation Learning ([Xavier Bresson](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/xbresson/))

On the fifth day of the school you will learn about fundamentals and recent trends in the field of **graph representation learning**
as one of the cornerstones for large-scale machine learning and analysis on network-structured data. 


### Lecture materials and outline

* Graph Convolutional Networks - Spectral Techniques
* Graph Convolutional Networks - Spatial Techniques (w/ a PyTorch hands-on session included)
* Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks


The **Lecture** subfolder contains materials from presentations. Slides of the lecture can be also found here: LINK_TO_LECTURES

The **Hands-on** subfolder contain materials for PyTorch hands-on session.

### Hands-on environemnt setup instructions

The hands-on session is organized as Jupyter notebooks, which you can run on your local computer.
Preparation for the hands-on session consists of setting up a python environment using Anaconda (Miniconda) and installing all necessary libraries. 
The procedure for this is as follows: ...
