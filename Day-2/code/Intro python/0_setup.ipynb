    "To complete the hands-on exercises, you will need a working `python 3.7` environment running on an operating system of your choice. For Windows, MacOS, and Linux users we recommend to install the latest [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), an OpenSource `python` distribution that comes pre-configured for data science and machine learning tasks. Just download and run the installer and you should have everything you need for this course.\n",
    "\n",

This will make sure that all the environment variables are correctly set. Moreover, to install packages it is best to open this command prompt as an administrator (or use `su` on a Unix-based system). To complete the practice lectures and group exercises, we will need the following additional packages: \n",
    "\n",
    "`juypter` - provides an environment for interactive data science projects in your browser. We will extensively use so-called `jupyter notebooks`, which are interactive computable documents that you can also use to compile reports.  \n",
    "`pathpy` - provides implementations of common scientific and statistical computing techniques for python.  \n",
    "`scipy` - provides implementations of common scientific and statistical computing techniques for python.  \n",
    "`numpy` - provides support for multi-dimensional arrays an matrices as well as high-level mathematical functions. This project originated as a smaller core part of `scipy`.  \n",
    "`matplotlib` - provides advanced plotting functions based on the data types introduced in `numpy`. Visualisations can be directly integrated into `jupyter` notebooks.  \n",
    "`pandas` - popular package for the management, analysis, and manipulation of multi-dimensional **pan**el **da**ta (thus the name). Provides convenient interfaces for the import and export of data from files or databases.  \n",

    "## Setting up `pathpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will use `pathpy`, a network analysis and visualisation package that is developed at my chair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to many other packages, `pathpy` has a couple of advantages. First, it is easy to install as should have no dependencies not included in a default `anaconda` installation. Seond, `pathpy` has a user-friendly API that makes it easy to handle directed and undirected networks, networks with single and multiple edges, multi-layer networks or temporal networks. It also provides interactive HTML visualisations that can be directly displayed inside `jupyter` notebooks, which makes it particularly suitable for educational settings. Third, it supports the analysis and visualisation of time series data on networked systems, such as time-stamped edges or data on paths in networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `pathpy` is not included in the default Anaconda installation, we first need to install it. In previous iterations of the course, we have used the stable version `pathy 2.0`. Right now, we are in the process of finishing a heavily revised version 3.0, which comes with many advantages. It has a cleaner API, is more efficient, and provides advanced plotting functions. To benefit from those advantages, we will use the development version of `pathpy3` from gitHub. The best way to install it is to (1) clone the git repository to a local directory, and (2) install an editable version of the `pathpy` module from this cloned repository. This allows you to run `git pull` to get the latest version. You can do this by opening a command line as administrator and run: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> git clone https://github.com/pathpy/pathpy pathpy3\n",
    "> cd pathpy3\n",
    "> pip install -e .\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new directory `pathpy3` on your machine. Changing to this directory and running `pip install -e .` will *install `pathpy` as an editable python module*. Rather than copying the code to a separate directory in your python module path, this creates a symbolic link to the current directory. This has the advantage that you can update your local installation of `pathpy` by entering the directory and running `git pull`. After this the new version will be immediately available in all `python` processes launched after the update. This allows us to update your local `pathpy` installations by means of a simple `git push`. Note that after updating `pathpy` you must always restart the python process (or jupyter kernel) before changes are effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pathpy` requires `python 3.x`. If you have both ` python 2.x` and `python 3.x` installed, you can explicitly install a package for `python 3` by using the command `pip3` instead of `pip`. Note that `python 2` is deprecated since April 2020, so you should always use `python 3` anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you may need to manually uninstall any previous major version of `pathpy`, e.g. uninstall the package `pathpy2` in case you have it installed from our data science course. You can check this via the command `pip list`. Uninstalling prior versions is necessary because all `pathpy` versions use the same namespace `pathpy` and for reasons of backwards compatibility we still provide older major versions in case someone needs them. If for some reason you want to quickly switch between different major versions, we recommend to use [virtual environments in Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)."

    "## Using `jupyter` notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that all the packages have been installed, you should be able to start a `jupyter` server, a process that can execute chunks of `python code` in a so-called `kernel` and return the result. This `jupyter` server can run local `python kernels`, which are actually local servers that accept requests with `python` code from clients, execute the code and then return the result. A popular but not the only way to interact with such `kernels` is through the browser-based clients `jupyter notebook` and `jupyter lab`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Those two clients are quite similar in the sense that both allow you to open, edit, and run `jupyter` notebooks in your browser. Each notebook consists of multiple input and output cells, where the input contains the code being executed while the adjacent output cell displays the result of the computation. Importantly, these cells can contain code in multiple languages such as `julia`, `python`, or `R` (note the name: `jupyter`), as well as Markdown-formatted text, chunks of HTML or even LaTeX equations. This makes `jupyter` notebooks a great tool to compile interactive computable documents, that can directly be exported to HTML or LaTex/PDF reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can use both the `jupyter notebook` or the `jupyter lab` server for this course, the latter as recently been released as the next-generation `jupyter` interface. We will thus use this for our course. To start a `jupyter lab` server, just navigate to the directory in your filesystem in which you wish to create or open a `jupyter` notebook and execute the following command in your terminal:\n",
