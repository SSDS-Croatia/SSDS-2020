### Lecture materials and outline

[placeholder]

The **Lecture** subfolder contains materials from presentations.

There are two hands-on examples, 

The folder "MultiNetworkExample" contains a hands-on example of the basics of node similarity, unsupervised network embedding, and multi-network analysis.  You will visualize two different notions of node similarity: one is based on the nodes' proximity to each other, and the other is based on the structural roles that they play in the network.  Preserving either of these node similarities can be an objective for network embedding, an unsupervised method for learning feature representations of nodes in networks.  You will see how these notions of node similarity and the resulting embeddings can be used to compare nodes within a network and across different networks, and how this can be used for cross-network comparison of not only individual nodes, but also entire graphs.  Finally, you will perform a small experiment studying the scalabilitiy of different embedding methods on progressively larger graphs.  
  
### Hands-on environment setup instructions

The hands-on session is organized as Jupyter notebooks, which you can run on your local computer.
For MultiNetworkExample, you only need the basic data science Python toolkit: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, as well as the NetworkX graph analysis library.  Source code for specific graph mining examples is included in that folder, and scripts for performing basic visual analysis and calling graph mining tasks are contained in the file analysis.py.  You will run the example.ipynb notebook to walk through all the examples step by step (with explanations of what is happening).
